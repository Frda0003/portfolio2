                <p>Our entrance examination at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology marked the beginning of
                    our journey as design
                    students. It was the first project we undertook, focused on introducing us to coding and web
                    development. The
                    examination required us to build our first website based on a layout, copy, and content predefined
                    by our teachers. <br> <br>
                    This project helped us grasp the basics of HTML and CSS, allowing us to apply theoretical knowledge
                    to practical tasks. It
                    was both challenging and rewarding, setting the foundation for future web design and development
                    projects.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The process was primarily focused on learning fundamental coding techniques, such as the
                    "mobile-first" approach, grid
                    layout, and media queries. These essential skills helped us structure responsive websites that adapt
                    to various screen
                    sizes. <br> <br>
                    Additionally, we learned how to utilize a CSS document to style our website, including applying
                    colors, font
                    styles, margins, padding, max-width, and flexbox properties. Another key part of the process was
                    styling the navigation
                    menu and footer using CSS, allowing us to customize the layout and appearance of our website to
                    create a more visually
                    appealing and functional design.

                <h2>Product</h2>
                <p>The final website design came together with a clean and modern look, following a predetermined
                    structure set by our
                    instructors. We were guided to implement a mobile-first approach, ensuring responsiveness across
                    devices. <br> <br>
                    The grid layout and media queries, which were specified in advance, provided the foundation for a
                    flexible design. Styling elements like colors, fonts, and spacing were predefined, and we applied
                    them using CSS to bring the layout to life. The
                    navigation menu and footer were also designed based on these instructions, creating a cohesive and
                    functional website as
                    outlined by our teachers.
