                <p>For my "04_Animation" project, I created an interactive click-based game centered around the American
                    election between
                    Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The game offers players a chance to explore the gain knowledge about
                    the election, eventhough it is biased
                    though engaging animations and decision-making elements. <br> <br>
                    My goal was to create an educational yet
                    entertaining experience that
                    reflects the importance of political figures. By combining dynamic visual effects with interactive
                    gameplay, I was able
                    to showcase my skills in animation, interactivity, and storytelling, making the project both fun and
                    informative.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The development of the "The election" was a multifaceted process that involved several new skills.
                    I began by learning JavaScript to build the interactive game logic, ensuring a dynamic user
                    experience. To plan out
                    animations and transitions, I used SVG state machine diagrams, which helped me visualize the flow.
                    <br> <br>
                    CSS animations were
                    then applied to create smooth, engaging effects throughout the game. Adobe Illustrator played a key
                    role in designing
                    custom graphics, while character design principles were used to develop visually clear and
                    expressive characters,
                    enhancing the gameâ€™s storytelling and user interaction.

                <h2>Product</h2>
                <p>The final product is a fun, interactive click-based game that offers a satirical twist on the
                    American election between
                    Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Designed to be both engaging and educational, the game provides
                    players with an
                    opportunity to explore key moments and decisions in the election while navigating through
                    interactive animations. The
                    graphics are simple yet clean, allowing users to easily follow the gameplay without distraction. The
                    use of a satirical
                    tone brings humor to the experience, making the game enjoyable while still offering insights into
                    political themes. <br> <br>
                    The
                    straightforward and intuitive design ensures that players, regardless of their familiarity with the
                    subject, can easily
                    understand how to play and engage with the content. The games user interface was carefully crafted
                    to enhance the
                    player experience, with easy-to-read text, smooth transitions, and a layout that complements the
                    gameplay. Overall, the
                    project merges humor, design, and interactivity to create an engaging and memorable experience.
