                <h2>PASSIONSITE</h2>
                <p>The 05_content theme was split into two projects, a passionsite and a redesign of a business site.
                    The
                    passion site
                    introduced me to
                    Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro, where I edited an interview with a
                    passionate jewelry
                    maker. <br> <br>
                    I learned how
                    to enhance storytelling through dynamic visuals and seamless editing, using After Effects for motion
                    graphics and
                    Premiere Pro for cutting and arranging footage. The experience deepened my appreciation for video
                    editing and helped me
                    express the subject's love for craftsmanship in a compelling, visual format.</p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The process of creating this project involved learning to design animated vector graphics, working
                    with LottieFiles for
                    smooth animations, and enhancing the visual storytelling. I spent time mastering sound editing and
                    video production,
                    ensuring the audio complemented the visuals perfectly. Creating detailed storyboards helped me plan
                    the sequence and
                    flow of the content. This combination of skills allowed me to produce a cohesive, engaging project
                    that effectively
                    communicated the subjects passion, while also showcasing my growing technical abilities in
                    animation and video editing.

                <h2>Product</h2>
                <p>The product was a dynamic website designed to showcase a jewelry maker’s passion and craft. It
                    featured a captivating
                    hero section with a LottieFile animation that set the tone for the theme. The design incorporated
                    thoughtfully chosen
                    fonts and color schemes that complemented the jewelry-making theme, creating an elegant and cohesive
                    visual experience.
                    A key element was a video interview that brought the artisan’s story to life, providing an intimate
                    connection with the
                    audience. Additionally, a gallery was included to display the jewelry creations, offering a vibrant,
                    interactive space
                    for visitors to explore and engage with the artist's work.

                <h2>BUSINESS SITE</h2>

                <p>The business site I worked on was a collaborative project with four other students, marking our first
                    experience working
                    together as a team. We used GitHub for version control, allowing us to simultaneously code in the
                    same document and
                    streamline our workflow. <br> <br> The project involved redesigning the website for a real jewelry
                    business,
                    where we took
                    inspiration from their existing online presence and integrated new content. We also captured fresh
                    images inside the
                    shop to give the website an authentic, personalized touch. </p>

                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>The process of creating the business site involved several key stages. We began by learning how to
                    collaborate
                    efficiently, coding together in the same file using GitHub, which was a new experience for our team.
                    We started with a
                    thorough design analysis of the existing website, identifying areas for improvement. Extensive
                    research followed to
                    understand the brand and user needs. <br> <br>We then created wireframes and digital prototypes to
                    map out the structure.
                    Crafting compelling copy helped convey the brands message clearly. Layout diagrams
                    guided our design
                    decisions, and implementing CSS variables gave us flexibility and consistency across the site.

                    and user-friendly
                    way. It featured detailed information about the business, its history, and the unique jewelry pieces
                    on offer. <br> <br>The
                    layout was clean and professional, with easy navigation to key sections like product offerings, an

                    customer testimonials. Contact options were prominently displayed, allowing potential clients to
